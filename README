Prerequisites
-------------


If Armonic has not been installed via Python distutils:
$ export PYTHONPATH=PATH_WHERE_ARMONIC_IS

Then, do Zephyrus and Metis available
$ export PATH=$PATH:PATH_WHERE_ZEPHYRUS_IS
$ export PATH=$PATH:PATH_WHERE_METIS_IS

Maybe, we also have to export some Zephyrus solver executables
$ export PATH=$PATH:PATH_WHERE_MINIZINC_IS
$ ...

Finally, we also suppose you have armonic-modules in the parent directory.


Run
---

The Aeolus toolchain is composed by 4 tools which are used
sequentialy on a shared workspace.


1) We build an application by providing a Armonic module repository:

   $ ./builder -L ../armonic-modules/ -w varnish_wp_mysql -x "Varnish//start"

   Follow instruction and please choose (for this example):
   	  Wordpress/Active/get_website
	  Mysql/Active/add_database

2) Considering we have choosen Wordpress and Mysql, we call
   Zephyrus and Metis by provinding specification and initial
   configuration files:

   $ ./maker -w varnish_wp_mysql -spec data/specifications/varnish-wp-mysql.spec  -ic data/configurations/many-locations-mbs.json


3) We have to fill missing variable values:

   $ ./filler -w varnish_wp_mysql -L ../armonic-modules/


4) And finally, we can launch the deployment. Here, we just print Armonic deployment commands:

   $ ./launcher -w varnish_wp_mysql -s
